### I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE CODE LINES. MOST OF THESE FILES ARE HELPERS, EXAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTS TO TAKE AS A REFERENCE

To run any of those files, you can use script_execute <name_of_the_file> (Requires sv_cheats 1) or include them in your mapspawn.nut as:
## Your "mapspawn.nut" file:
```Squirrel
// This will include your script in the root scope
IncludeScript("name_of_the_file");

// Including it in a specific scope
IncludeScript("name_of_the_file", your_scope)
```
## NOTE
Most of these files are independent and don't require anything. Not even cs_custom_functions.nut
